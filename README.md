# Efficient Brain Tumor Classification using Filter-Based Deep Feature Selection Methodology

## Description:

> Methodology

- Implementation of a novel two-stage framework for classifying 3 kinds of brain tumors and healthy patients from structural MRI scans.
- In the first stage, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network has been used to extract relevant features from pre-processed images through transfer learning, considerably reducing training time and extensive hardware requirements.
- In the second stage, a filter-based deep feature selection methodology using Mutual Information has been applied to minimize the extracted, high-dimensional feature maps.
- Finally, a Support Vector Machine with a polynomial kerenl ruse has been used for multi-class classification.
